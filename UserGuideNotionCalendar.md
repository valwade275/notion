# Notion Calendar User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to Valerie's Notion Calendar User Guide. This guide will help you navigate and effectively use Notion's new Calendar feature to manage your schedule, events, and tasks. 

## Purpose
Notion is a superb productivity tool, but having to leave Notion to manage your calendar in another app decreases efficiency. Notion Calendar addresses this problem by enabling you to connect your Google Calendar to Notion. This way, your project timelines, meetings, and other calendar items can be managed from one space along with your documents and databases. 

## Audience
This user guide is for beginners who are looking to enhance their productivity within the Notion platform. Users should create a Notion account before working through this user guide.

    * To add, edit, or remove the event's location, select the *Location* field and make your changes. 
    * To add, edit, or remove the event's type, open the dropdown menu within the event. There are three event types: *Event*, *Focus time*, and *Out of Office*. Select your desired type. 
    * To show your status as *Busy* or *Free*, use the right panel within the event. Similarly, you can edit the event's privacy by choosing *Public* or *Private*.
