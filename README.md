# notion
My technical writing samples based on the Notion app.

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a space for samples of my technical writing for the way I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). All of the documentation here is self-authored, and it showcases my knowledge of Git, Markdown, and other tools. 

I am choosing Notion as the foundation for this part of my portfolio because I have found it to be an extremely useful platform for my technical writing and other work. For instance, I use Notion to organize home improvement projects, catalogue my gardens, and organize family trips. 

You can view a few other samples of my work on my [website](https://vcwade.com/tech/). 

I hope you find the documentation here useful. If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/valwade275#%EF%B8%8F-lets-connect). 

Enjoy!
